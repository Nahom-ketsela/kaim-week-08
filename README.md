Project Scope

This project follows a structured approach to data analysis, feature engineering, and model building to enhance fraud detection.

Key Objectives

🔹 Data Preprocessing & Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, correct data types, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

🔹 Geolocation Analysis: Merge transaction data with IP address geolocation mapping to detect location-based fraud patterns.

🔹 Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful insights such as transaction frequency, velocity, and time-based attributes (e.g., hour of the day, day of the week).

🔹 Machine Learning Model Development: Train and optimize fraud detection models using advanced ML algorithms.

🔹 Model Evaluation & Improvement: Analyze model performance and refine predictions using hyperparameter tuning.

🔹 Deployment & Monitoring: Implement real-time fraud detection and continuous model improvement.

Dataset Overview

The project utilizes multiple datasets for fraud detection and geolocation analysis:

📌 Fraud_Data.csv – Contains e-commerce transaction details (user_id, purchase_time, purchase_value, IP address, etc.).

📌 IpAddress_to_Country.csv – Maps IP address ranges to their corresponding countries.

📌 creditcard.csv – Includes anonymized banking credit transactions.

Data Processing & Feature Engineering

1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handle missing values through imputation/removal.

Remove duplicate records.

Convert timestamps to datetime format.

Convert ip_address from float to integer for geolocation matching.


2️⃣ Geolocation-Based Fraud Detection

Convert IP addresses to integer format for matching with country IP ranges.

Merge Fraud_Data.csv with IpAddress_to_Country.csv to detect location anomalies.


3️⃣ Feature Engineering

Time-Based Features: Extract purchase_hour and purchase_day_of_week.

Transaction Frequency: Compute user_transaction_count to identify users with abnormally high activity.


4️⃣ Normalization & Encoding

StandardScaler: Normalize purchase_value to ensure consistent feature scaling.

Label Encoding: Convert categorical variables (source, browser, sex) into numerical values for ML models.
